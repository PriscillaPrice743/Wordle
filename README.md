# WordleSolver
A program to beat my friends in wordle.

## Files
wordle_solver.py contains all the final code for solving wordle.

### Data folder
valid-words.txt contains all valid wordle words. Credit to [Sean Patlan](https://github.com/seanpatlan) where I found this [csv](https://github.com/seanpatlan/wordle-words/blob/main/valid-words.csv) of valid wordle words which I turned into a txt file. 

first_word_stats.csv contains saved data from computing the best first word (takes a bit too long for normal play).
