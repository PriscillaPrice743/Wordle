# WordleSolver
A program to beat my friends in wordle.

wordle_solver.py contains all the final code for solving wordle.

first_word_stats.csv contains saved data from computing the best first word (takes a bit too long for normal play).

wordle_solver_dev.ipynb contains the development code which helped me visualize the vectorized operations I used.
